It also provides a mechanism for handling empty input fields, setting these as null in the user profile.|

|[create_ADGroup.ps1](https://github.com/beepbomark/Useful-Scripts/blob/main/PowerShell%20Scripts/create_ADGroup.ps1)|This PowerShell script is designed to create a single Active Directory (AD) group.
